# Research on perturbation suppression of non-periodic lattice laser based on LQR control
## Jiaxin Zhou 's reserach on semiconductor laser and LQR control

- using meep as the model tools
- using matlab to linearize the laser model

### Process
> Model the process of semiconductor  
> Model the aperiodic grating

### What I need now?
- Equation between the current/voltage and laser frequency
- Equations of the grating about how to tune the frequency of laser
