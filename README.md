# Research on Meep 's application in semiconductor laser
## Jiaxin Zhou 's reserach on semiconductor laser 


- using meep as the model tools
- using matlab to linearize the laser model
---
### Process 
- Import the structure of QCL  
- Import the grating structure
---
### What I need now?
- How the current control the source?  
- What kind of sources I need for simulation?  
- True parameters of different materials  
- True thickness of different layers  
---
### Next step to do   
- Simulation on single grating structure  
- Set up the detector to see the shape of flux
